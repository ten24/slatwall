# Getting Started

Development Setup

- navigate to custom/swreact
- npm install

Running React App

- npm run start
- PROJECT_NAME:3006 Ex: http://stoneandberg:3006
- When you run this you will not get a page returned by the Slatwall Server. The react application will be served from its own node server. That means no coldfusion code will run.
- All content will retrieved via the api. The API will call http://stoneandberg:8906.
- You will get added benefits from developing like this. as you make changes on save the web-server will update the page in the browser without needing to reload the page.

Running Production Built app

- PROJECT_NAME:8906 Ex: http://stoneandberg:8906
- When you access the application here you will be running the compiled "production build" of the app. Each page refresh will return a page from the Slatwall server but content will still be retrieved from thought the api. Coldfusion page lifecycle code will be called.
- If you click on a link in the app and migrate to a new page you will not make a full page reload to the server. This is a "Single Page App" so the routing is handled internally.
- You probably donâ€™t need to run here unless you are working on something "lifecycle related" or working on setting up paths, because adding pages in Slatwall will not make them show up automatically in the react app without proper routing. This will be changed eventually but right now this is how it works.
- Any local changes you make will not be visible here unless you do a npm run build.

Building (You should not so that)

- npm run build
- Access built app: PROJECT_NAME:8906 Ex: http://stoneandberg:8906/

# About React

The docs are really good: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

## useState

- used to call data after the component is rendered. you dont want to block here and is only called once per render.
- docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#declaring-a-state-variable

## useEffect

- used to call data after the component is rendered. you dont want to block here and is only called once per render.
- docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html

# About Redux

Study the concepts: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts
Primary concepts: https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers
** The redux store is cleared on every full page reload **

- Make sure to use the Link component from react-router-dom instead of an a tag.

## Dev Tools

- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en
- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/

## Actions

An action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.

## Reducers

Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result.

## Thunk

An action that returns a function

## mapStateToProps

Docs: https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapstate
This will allow you to map data in the store to a Component Prop.

### useSelector

A hook version of mapStateToProps which I find messy.
Docs: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#useselector

## useDispatch

A React hook that allows you to call an Action
Docs: https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#usedispatch

# Getting Content

Example: custom/swreact/src/pages/About/About.js

The key of the content object will tell the API to get all content that matches that regex

- Key "about" will get ["about", "about/1", "about/2"] ==> Like "%about%"
- Key "about/" will get ["about/1", "about/2"]
  The value object will be an array of db columns you want.

## Setting HTML

- dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- Intercept onClick and push

# Getting Custom Data in Redux

Dispatch Lifecycle

- requestXXXX() --> This mostly sets isFetching for UI blocking
- receiveXXXX() --> This will update the store. dont forget to set isFetching to false.

## Example: Add to Cart

- Action: custom/swreact/src/actions/cartActions.js
- Reducer: custom/swreact/src/reducers/cartReducer.js
- addToCart Action Is a Thunk.
- requestCart() ==> Call API ==> receiveCart()
  -- requestCart() will tell the reducer isFetching = true
  -- receiveCart() will tell the reducer isFetching = false and add the cart to the reducer state

## Example: Logout

- File: custom/swreact/src/actions/authActions.js
- Logout Action Is a Thunk because it returns a function
- It calls a standard Action "softLogout" which cleans up some of the state and localstorage data.

# Getting Custom Data for local component state

- Example: custom/swreact/src/pages/ProductDetail/ProductDetailGallery.js
- the useState hook will allow us to set data local to this component.

# Forms

## Slatwall content forms

Example: custom/swreact/src/pages/About/About.js

## Formik Form

Example: custom/swreact/src/components/Account/AccountProfile/AccountProfile.js
Docs: https://formik.org/docs/tutorial#overview-what-is-formik

# ES6 Notes
