Any DAO's that you place in this directory will be used instead of the default.

For example if you'd like to take full control over the productDAO.cfc in slatwall.
Just create a file in this directory called ProductDAO.cfc, and extend Slatwall.model.dao.ProductDAO

In addition you can add additional DAO objects that will be available in the core slatwall bean factory
