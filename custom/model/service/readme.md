Any Services that you place in this directory will be used instead of the default.

For example if you'd like to take full control over the ProductService.cfc in slatwall.
Just create a file in this directory called ProductService.cfc, and extend Slatwall.model.service.ProductService

In addition you can add additional Service objects that will be available in the core slatwall bean factory
