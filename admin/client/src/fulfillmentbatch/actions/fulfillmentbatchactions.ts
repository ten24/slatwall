/**
 * ------------------------
 * Importing these Actions:
 * 
 * Action constants are used in both the controller (to dispatch to the correct reducer) 
 * as well as the service (where the reducer lives).
 * These can be imported using * and then aliased (such as action) such that
 * they can be referenced from multiple places as action.TOGGLE_EDITCOMMENT.
 * The naming convention is slightly different for UI actions and server actions.
 * ---
 * Server Based Actions:
 * 
 * A server action example would be any object CRUD like SAVE_COMMENT, DELETE_PRODUCT, ETC.
 * A server action also has a third part added: Requested | Success | Fail so the action may be
 * dispatched as SAVE_COMMENT_REQUESTED but would be returned as SAVE_COMMENT_SUCCESS or SAVE_COMMENT_FAILED.
 * ---
 * UI Based Actions:
 * 
 * UI actions do not include the REQUESTED|SUCCESS|FAILED part because they are simple enough that
 * they should not do anything other than success.
 *
