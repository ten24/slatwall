--->

<!--- This header include should be changed to the header of your site.  Make sure that you review the header to include necessary JS elements for slatwall templates to work ---> 
<cfinclude template="_slatwall-header.cfm" />

<!--- This import allows for the custom tags required by this page to work --->
<cfimport prefix="sw" taglib="../tags" />

<!---[DEVELOPER NOTES]															
																				
	If you would like to customize any of the public tags used by this			
	template, the recommended method is to uncomment the below import,			
	copy the tag you'd like to customize into the directory defined by			
	this import, and then reference with swc:tagname instead of sw:tagname.		
	Technically you can define the prefix as whatever you would like and use	
	whatever directory you would like but we recommend using this for			
	the sake of convention.														
																				
	<cfimport prefix="swc" taglib="/Slatwall/custom/public/tags" />
