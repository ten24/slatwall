	- You also meet the terms and conditions of the license of each
	  independent module
	- You must not alter the default display of the Slatwall name or logo from
	  any part of the application
	- Your custom code must not alter or create any files inside Slatwall,
	  except in the following directories:
		/integrationServices/

	You may copy and distribute the modified version of this program that meets
	the above guidelines as a combined work under the terms of GPL for this program,
	provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the
	GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.

    If you modify this program, you may extend this exception to your version
