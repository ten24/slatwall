    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this program give you

    modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting program under terms 
    of your choice, provided that you follow these specific guidelines: 

	- You also meet the terms and conditions of the license of each 
	  independent module 
	- You must not alter the default display of the Slatwall name or logo from  
	  any part of the application 
	- Your custom code must not alter or create any files inside Slatwall, 
	  except in the following directories:
		/integrationServices/

	You may copy and distribute the modified version of this program that meets 
	the above guidelines as a combined work under the terms of GPL for this program, 
	provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the 
	GNU GPL requires distribution of source code.
    
    If you modify this program, you may extend this exception to your version

Notes:

    tabDirectory is the name of the tab directory without the path. It is assumed it lives in the custom/admin/views/entity/tabDirectory/customtabs/tabsName file.
    tabName is both the name of the tab file without the file extention as well as the name that displays on the tab.
