Any Report's that you place in this directory which are named the same as the reports found in /Slatwall/model/report/ will override the default behavior of that 'built in' report.

However you can also drop in additional reports that are named something custom, and they will show up in the reporting framework as a separate report link.  To illustrate this, you can copy one of the default reports, rename it with something unique, place it in this directory, and reload the reporting framework in the admin.
