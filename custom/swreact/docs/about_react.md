The docs are really good: https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

# useState

- used to store data local to the component
- docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html#declaring-a-state-variable

# useEffect

- used to call data after the component is rendered. you don't want to block here and is only called once per render.
- docs: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
